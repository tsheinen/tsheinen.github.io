Howdy!  My name is Teddy (they/them)!  I'm a current computer science student at Texas A&M (Class of 2021) minoring in cybersecurity.  You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teddyheinen/), [GitHub](https://github.com/tcheinen), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theinen_), and I'm reachable by email at [teddy@heinen.dev](mailto:teddy@heinen.dev).  My resume may be found [here](https://teddyheinen.com/resume.pdf)!

Academically, I'm interested in pretty much anything related to security, with a particular focus on lower-level security. I'm a frequent CTF competitor (usually either solo or with the Texas A&M Cybersecurity Club) and I work on [TAMUctf](https://github.com/tamuctf/). My specialty, ctf-wise, is binary exploitation and reverse engineering.
