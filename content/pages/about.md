Howdy!  I'm Thea "Teddy" Heinen (they/them or she/her)!  You can find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/tsheinen) or [Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@theinen), and I'm reachable by email at [me@heinen.dev](mailto:me@heinen.dev).

I CTF with [idek](https://ctftime.org/team/157039/) and mostly do binary exploitation. 

I like working on software to solve hard security problems -- focusing on low-level systems. 

In my free time I like to crochet and play with my cat Winter :)
