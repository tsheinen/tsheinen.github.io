Howdy!  My name is Teddy (they/them)!  You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/teddyheinen/), [GitHub](https://github.com/tsheinen), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/theinen_), and I'm reachable by email at [teddy@heinen.dev](mailto:teddy@heinen.dev).  My resume may be found [here](https://heinen.dev/resume.pdf)!

I CTF sometimes with various teams or solo. I mostly do binary exploitation or reverse engineering and I'm particularly interested in automatic exploitation and reverse engineering. 

In my free time I like to crochet and play with my cat Winter :)
